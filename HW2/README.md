# How to install

## install eclipse 
just install and wait

## create pom.xml (dependencies)

follow this > [https://spring.io/quickstart](https://spring.io/quickstart)

## Docker (optional) 
I tried to install all of it and "everything" inside container for development. I found that most of debugging tools don't work

But I can create container for deployment see docker-compose.yaml that's in root dir
